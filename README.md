# Crowdfunding_ETL

A mini project performing ETL skills on a large dataset. Python was used to extract and transform, SQL is used to load and query the data.

## Overview 

For this ETL mini project, We practised building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data.

After the data is transformed, we created four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

Using Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and a PostgreSQL(pgAdmin) database:

 * Extracted and transformed data from a large Excel file into smaller CSV files
 * Created a PostgreSQL database and tables by using an ERD
 * Loaded CSV files into a database
 * Ran queries to retrieve data and generate reports for stakeholders
